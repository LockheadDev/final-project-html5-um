      <p>
        This game is one of the best rougelikes in the market, its charming characters, superb gameplay and lore
        makes it addictive and infinite fun, also the art has a particular style that for sure will make your eyes
        appreciate the details.

      <p>
        This game forces you to work, all the logical and OCD brain-work will scratch an itch that not any managment
        game has, if you like management simulators I highly recommend this game.

      <p>
        It is the best succesor of the original Roller Coaster Tycoon games, with decent graphics and expansive
        community, which will let you explore all your creative desires and perhaps frustrated Roller Coaster
        designer dreams.

      <h3>
        Dota
      </h3>

        width="640" height="360">
      <p>
        This MOBA is one of the hardest games to play, the learning curve is really steep, but playing with friend
        can end in really fun times or having ending fighting with your bros.
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Steam Page &not;</a>

      <p>
        Another superb rougelike that scratches the 3D bullethell itch you can have, even if it is taxing on your
        system this game will keep you playing for at leat 3 hours per session, it can sometimes be kind of harsh on
        new players, but slowly you can get the hang of it.

        Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p>These are my personal favourites, lately I have been obsessed with rougelike games which have a really nice
        gameplay loop, which is rewarding for the average player, I dont like games that are frustrating like Elden Ring
        or Dark Souls, I prefer too keep it simple and fun.</p>
